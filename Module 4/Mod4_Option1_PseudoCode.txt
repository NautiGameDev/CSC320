CSC320 Module 4 Option 1

Retrieves 5 inputs from the user and calculates the Total, Average, Max, Min, and Interest at 20%

Start Program
	Program set-up
		Initiate scanner object
		Create integer variable to set the number of inputs (Default to 5)
		Create float variable for interest % (Default to 20% or 0.2f)
		Create an array of floats to store user inputs, set size of array to number of inputs

	Program loop
		Create Boolean called isRunning set to true
		Create while loop to run continuously while isRunning is true
		Print line to console explaining the program ("User to enter 5 numbers")
		
		Get user inputs
			Initialize i at 0 to represent for loop index
			For loop if i is less than then number of inputs established in program set-up
				Call method GetInputs()
					Create Boolean called isInputValid set to false
					Create while loop to run while isInputValid is false
					Establish try-catch to retrieve user input
						Try user input is float
							if input is valid 
								Store user input in userInputs float array at index in for loop
								set isInputValid to true to close whileloop
						Catch user input is not valid
							Print statement informing user the input isn't valid
							Repeat while loop until a valid number is entered

		Calculate total
			Create float variable called total and call method to calculate the total of user inputs
				Initialize total at 0
				Initialize i at 0 for for-loop index
				Create a for loop to execute block of code while index is less than the length of userInputs array
					Add each value in userInputs array to the total
				Return total

		Calculate average
			Create float variable called average and call method to calculate the average
				Create average variable set to the total divided by the length of user inputs
				return average

		Calculate maximum
			Create float variable called maximum and call method to find the maximum input value
				Create float variable called Maximum set to 0
				Initialize i at 0 for for-loop index
				Create for loop to execute block of code while index is less than the length of userInputs array
					if input value at array index is greater than maximum value, set maximum value equal to input value
				return Maximum Number

		Calculate minimum
			Create float variable called minimum and call method to find the minimum input value
				Create float variable called minimum and set to total value of all inputs
				Initialize i at 0 for for-loop index
				Create for loop to execute block of code while index is less than length of userInputs array
					if input value at array index is less than minimum variable, set minimum value equal to input value at array index
				return Minimum

		Calculate interest
			Create float variable called interest and call method to calculate interest value
				Create float value set to the total of all input values multiplied by program's interest value (default 20%)
				return interest value

		Print all calculated values
			Print total value of user inputs to console
			Print average of user inputs to console
			Print maximum value of user inputs to console
			Print minimum value of user inputs to console
			Print interest value of user inputs to console

		Repeat or Close program
			Set Boolean isRunning to returned value of function that retrieves new user input
				Initialse Boolean called isInputValid to check if new input is valid set to false
				Create a while loop that repeats if input is not valid
				Print message to console asking user to enter Y to repeat program, or N to close program
				If input is N
					set Boolean isInputValid to true
					return false
				Else if input is Y
					set Boolean isInputValid to true
					return true
				Else
					Print line to console stating the user input is invalid
			If Boolean isRunning returns as false
				Close program
			If Boolean isRunning remains true
				Repeat program
