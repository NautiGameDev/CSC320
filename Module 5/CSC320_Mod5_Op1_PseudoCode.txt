Retrieves user input of a day or "week" and prints out the average temperature requested.

Start Program

    Program Set-up
        Instantiate Scanner called userInput.
	Instantiate Random called random.
	Create String array called days with values set to names of each day.
	Create integer array called dailyTemps set to a size of 7.
	    Call method to randomly generate temperatures.
	        Create empty integer array called temperatures set to size 7.
		Create integer called baseTemp set to 60.
		Create integer called maxTemp set to 30.
		For loop to loop through each value in temperatures array.
		    Generate random number between 0 and 30, then add to 60. (Gets temp between 60-90 degrees)
		    Set value in temperatures array at index i to randomly generated number.
		    Return temperatures array.
	Instantiate Boolean called programRunning set to true.
	Create while loop based on condition programRunning.

    Program loop
	Print line to console providing user instructions to enter day of week or week, or Q to exit.
	Instantiate Boolean called isInputValid set to false.
	
	Create while loop with condition isInputValid is false.
	    Get user input set to String called userPrompt.
	    Instantiate integer temperatureOutput that calls method to get daily temperature.
		Instantiate integer called temperature set to 0.
		Create for loop based on length of days array.
		    Test if value at index i of days array is equal to user prompt.
			If true, set temperature variable to value at index i of dailyTemps array.
            Return temperature to main program loop

	If returned value of temperatureOutput is not 0
	    Print message displaying day and the value of temperatureOutput (average temperature)
	    Set isInputValid to false to exit input loop.

	Else if userPrompt equals "week"
	    Call method to get weekly temperatures.
		Instantiate integer called tempTotal set to 0.
		For loop based on length of days array.
		    Print message to console for each day stating the day of the week and the average temperature for that day.
		    Add daily average temperature to tempTotal variable.
		Calculate average weekly temperature by dividing tempTotal by the size of days array.
		Print Average weekly temperature to the console.

	Else if user input equals "Q"
	    set Program running to false to exit main program loop
	    Return to exit input loop
	
	Else (Input is invalid)
	   print message to console stating the input is invalid

	Set programRunning to returned Boolean of method asking user to repeat program
	    Print message to console asking user to enter Y or N to repeat the program again with a new parameter.
	    Instantiate Boolean titled isInputValid set to false
	    Create while loop based on condition isInputValid is false.
	        Get user input as string.
		If user input equals "Y"
                    Return true
                else if user input equals "N"
                    Return false
                else
                    Print message to terminal informing the user the input is invalid.
